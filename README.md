In this code i make it so that whatever is input, gets printed in a vertical form in a box like shape, 

Now for line 1, We take the INPUT
since we need a +---+ at the top and the bottom, we can just print these before and after

Then we run a for loop with the range of the text input we took
we have it print | i | , where i is out text
